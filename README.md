#### Welcome to my Profile :P

About me ?Â¿

- Some days, I amaze myself. Other days, I put my keys in the fridge.
- My favorite machine at the gym is the vending machine.
- I made a to-do list for today. I just canâ€™t figure out whoâ€™s going to do it.
- People say nothing is impossible, but I do nothing every day.
- I am athletic, canâ€™t you tell? Iâ€™m known to surf the web for hours.
